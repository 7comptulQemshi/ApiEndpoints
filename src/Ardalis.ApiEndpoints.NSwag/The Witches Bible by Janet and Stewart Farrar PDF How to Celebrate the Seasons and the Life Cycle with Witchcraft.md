The book is divided into two parts: The Sabbats and Rites for Birth, Marriage and Death. The first part explores the eight seasonal festivals that mark the Wiccan year, such as Imbolc, Beltane, Samhain, and Yule. The authors explain the symbolism, mythology, and customs associated with each sabbat, and provide detailed instructions on how to perform the rituals. The second part deals with the rites of passage that celebrate the milestones of human life, such as Wiccaning, Handfasting, and Requiem. The authors describe the meaning and purpose of these ceremonies, and offer sample scripts and variations for different situations.
 
The Witches' Bible is based on the authors' own experience as initiates of the Gardnerian tradition of Wicca, which was founded by Gerald Gardner in the 1950s. The book includes several ritual passages that were written by Doreen Valiente, Gardner's high priestess and a prominent figure in modern witchcraft. The book also reflects the authors' adaptations and innovations of the Gardnerian system, as well as their influences from other sources such as Robert Graves, Aleister Crowley, and Margaret Murray.
