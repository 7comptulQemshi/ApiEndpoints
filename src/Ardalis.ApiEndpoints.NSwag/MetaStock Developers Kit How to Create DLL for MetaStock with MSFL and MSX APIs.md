# How to create DLL for MetaStock
 
DLL stands for Dynamic Link Library, which is a file that contains code and data that can be used by multiple programs at the same time. DLL files can enhance the functionality of MetaStock, a technical analysis software for traders, by allowing users to create custom formula functions, indicators, system tests, explorations, and experts.
 
To create DLL for MetaStock, you need to have some programming skills and use the MetaStock Developer's Kit (MDK), which is a resource for experienced programmers who want to develop tools for MetaStock. The MDK includes three components: the MetaStock File Library API, the MetaStock External Functions API, and the Custom User Interface Utility.

The MetaStock File Library (MSFL) API allows you to read legacy MetaStock (version 11 and previous) price data files in your own applications. It supports C, C++, Pascal, and Visual Basic languages and comes as a Win 32 DLL with sample code and applications.
 
The MetaStock External Functions (MSX) API allows you to create custom formula functions in a Win 32 DLL using conventional programming languages such as C, C++, Pascal, and PowerBASIC. The MSX functions can be used in MetaStock's custom indicators, system tests, explorations, and experts. You can access all the price data for the current security and use up to nine arguments per function. The MSXTest application is provided for verifying and stress-testing your DLL.
 
The Custom User Interface Utility allows you to add or delete buttons and menu items in MetaStock's toolbar and menus. You can link to applications, MetaStock templates or layouts, documents, URLs, and more.
